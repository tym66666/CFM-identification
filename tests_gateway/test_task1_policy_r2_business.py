"""D7/D8 policy mean and two-policy difference through the R2 business route.

R1B already covers these designs; this pins the newly connected R2 route, where
the reading explicitly adopts mean-signature sufficiency. The dispatcher plans
both routes; here we drive the R2 plan row directly so the endpoint that was
previously excluded for the new designs is exercised end to end.
